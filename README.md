# neoPixel
MicroPython code to control strips of NeoPixels, WS2812

I did not write this, and I wanted to apply my change to whereever I got it from.
However, I could not find the original source so I was unable to apply it there.

Rather than lose it or keep it to myself, I released it here.

basically, use it as shown in example.py
